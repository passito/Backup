a)Elevator pitch:
Don't you feel that today everything related to the covid has become
very confusing? Every day something new happens. This simple application
tracks the vaccination that allows you to control the vaccination day of
each person and of each different vaccine.

b) App title:  Vaccination list

c) App Description:


The main use of this app is to be able to write a list of people with their
date of vaccination against covid. Three different types of vaccines are
currently in use. In the menu you can select the name of the vaccine and
then you can insert the name of the patient and his vaccination date.
And once that person has attended the appointment, you will be able to
eliminate it.

In addition, another feature of this application is that it has another
function that you will be able to access from the menu where you can see
the number of cases and the number of people recovered against covid.
